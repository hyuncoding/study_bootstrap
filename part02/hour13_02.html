                Taraxacum /t'rækskm/ is a large genus of flowering plants in the
                family Asteraceae. They are native to Eurasia and North and
                South America, and two species, T. officinale and T.
                erythrospermum, are found as weeds worldwide. Both species are
                edible in their entirety. The common name dandelion (/'dændla.n/
                dan-di-ly-n, from French dent-de-lion, meaning "lion's tooth")
                is given to members of the genus and, like other members of the
                Asteraceae family, they have very small flowers collected
                together into a composite flower head. Each single flower in a
                head is called a floret. Many Taraxacum species produce seeds
                asexually by apomixis, where the seeds are produced without
                pollination, resulting in offspring that are genetically
                identical to the parent plant.
